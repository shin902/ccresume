## Installation

### Via npx (Recommended)

```bash
npx @sasazame/ccresume@latest
```

### Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g @sasazame/ccresume
```

## Usage

Run the command in your terminal:

```bash
ccresume
```

Or if using npx:

```bash
npx @sasazame/ccresume@latest
```

### Command Line Options

#### ccresume Options

```bash
# Hide specific message types
ccresume --hide              # Default: hides tool and thinking messages
ccresume --hide tool         # Hide only tool messages
ccresume --hide thinking      # Hide only thinking messages
ccresume --hide user         # Hide only user messages
ccresume --hide assistant    # Hide only assistant messages
ccresume --hide tool thinking user  # Hide multiple types

# Filter to current directory
ccresume .

# Show help
ccresume --help
ccresume -h

# Show version
ccresume --version
ccresume -v
```

#### Passing Options to Claude

All unrecognized command-line arguments are passed directly to the `claude` command when resuming a conversation.

```bash
# Pass options to claude
ccresume --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Multiple options
ccresume --model opus --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Combine ccresume and claude options
ccresume --hide tool --model opus 
ccresume . --hide --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**⚠️ Warning**: Since unrecognized arguments are passed to claude, avoid using options that conflict with ccresume's functionality:
- Don't use options like `--resume` or something like that changes claude's interactive behavior

## Requirements

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **Claude Code** - Must be installed and configured
- **Operating System** - Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (both native & WSL)

## Command Editor

Press `-` to open the command editor, where you can configure Claude CLI options before starting or resuming a session. The editor provides:

- **Autocomplete suggestions** - Type `-` to see matching Claude options
- **Official help text** - View all available Claude CLI options
- **Interactive editing** - Use arrow keys, Tab for autocomplete, Enter to confirm

The configured options will be passed to Claude when you start a new session (`n`) or resume a conversation (`Enter`).

**Note**: The options list is based on Claude's help text at a specific point in time. Please refer to `claude --help` for the latest available options. Some options like `-r`, `-c`, `-h` may interfere with ccresume's functionality.

## Keyboard Controls

### Default Key Bindings

| Action | Keys |
|--------|------|
| Quit | `q` |
| Select Previous | `↑` |
| Select Next | `↓` |
| Confirm/Resume | `Enter` |
| Start New Session | `n` |
| Edit Command Options | `-` |
| Copy Session ID | `c` |
| Scroll Up | `k` |
| Scroll Down | `j` |
| Page Up | `u`, `PageUp` |

### Custom Key Bindings

#### Configuration File Location

ccresume looks for its configuration file in the following locations (in order of priority):

1. **`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable**: If set, ccresume will look for `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/config.toml`
2. **`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable**: If set, ccresume will look for `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/ccresume/config.toml`
3. **Default location**: `~/.config/ccresume/config.toml`

**Example:**
```bash
# Store ccresume config alongside other Claude-related configurations
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=~/.config
export CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/claude

# Or use a custom location
export CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/path/to/custom/config
```

**Note:** It is recommended to use absolute paths for `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`.

#### Configuration Format

You can customize key bindings by creating a configuration file:

```toml
[keybindings]
quit = ["q", "ctrl+c", "esc"]
selectPrevious = ["up", "k"]
selectNext = ["down", "j"]
confirm = ["enter", "l"]
copySessionId = ["y"]
scrollUp = ["u", "ctrl+u"]
scrollDown = ["d", "ctrl+d"]
scrollPageUp = ["b", "ctrl+b"]
scrollPageDown = ["f", "ctrl+f"]
scrollTop = ["g"]
scrollBottom = ["shift+g"]
pageNext = ["right", "n"]
pagePrevious = ["left", "p"]
startNewSession = ["n"]
openCommandEditor = ["-"]
toggleFullView = ["f"]
```

See `config.toml.example` in the repository for a complete example.

## 🐞 Known Issues

Below are known issues and limitations. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

| No. | Title | Description | Issue |
|:---:|:------|:-------------|:-----|
| 1 | **Incomplete conversation history restoration on resume** | When resuming with ccresume, sometimes, only the tail end of the history is restored. Although the interactive `claude -r` can restore full history. Workaround: use `claude -r` interactively or `claude -c`. | [#2](https://github.com/sasazame/ccresume/issues/2) |
| 2 | **~~Restore original console state after exiting ccresume~~** | ~~Exiting `ccresume` leaves the chat selection interface visible and hides previous terminal content.~~ **This is fixed in v0.3.1**: Terminal scrollback buffer is now preserved when exiting. | [#3](https://github.com/sasazame/ccresume/issues/3) |
| 3 | **Resume ordering may be incorrect** | For performance issue, `ccresume` sorts logs by file system timestamps (not chat content), so display order may not match actual chronology after migration. Workaround: preserve file timestamps. | – |
| 4 | **Windows native terminal limitations** | On Windows native terminals, interactive features may have limited functionality due to terminal input handling differences. Temporarily, in the Windows native environment, a warning message will be displayed before startup. | [#32](https://github.com/sasazame/ccresume/issues/32) |
